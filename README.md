# Translator

## To improve:

- Create an index on field "word" to improve performance for queries
- Write unit and integration tests (using pytest)
- Design error handling to catch and respond to different error scenarios gracefully
- Implement logging to record events and errors
- Use security practices, validating inputs and managing dependencies
- Manage configurations for different environments: development, testing, production
- Use Poetry as packaging and dependency manager
- Add cashing (before we should test current realisation with indexing. It must work really fast)
- Add user authentication via external service or 3rd party
- Use poetry to declare, manage and install dependencies
